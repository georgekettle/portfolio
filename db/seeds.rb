He listens he understands and make the presentations awesome. Areas for improvement is that he moves quickly. This isn't because he lacks awareness its because he has a lot to get through in about an hour and half. Students who are a little slower to understand concepts get lost easily. My suggestion would be to break up long lectures. Morning and after-lunch lectures. He goes off on a tangent when he's ready but that's because he's super excited. But if it wasn't for those tangent moments, we wouldn't know about turbo, hotwire, tailwind, and other important concepts which make our job easier. But honestly, George is a legend. Hard to find any negatives about him." },

But whenever we were stuck in projects, He always had the answer. Would love to have worked with him in person and pick his brain a little more. He was always supportive positive. Thanks George" },

His deep understanding of the fundamentals also allowed him to explain concepts to us very clearly. You can tell he really enjoys software engineering. Really funny guy so was easy to build rapport in and out of lectures. He was really good at problem-solving skills, being able to resolve our issues quickly or even suggest alternative solutions. Went above and beyond a lot." },
  { source: "Batch 1044 (Melbourne)", content: "George was such a great teacher, he had the ability to jump onto any ticket (no matter how complicated) and would normally have the solution within a couple of mins which was amazing! Super helpful and so thankful for him helping out on many occasions! He also showed us loads of libraries and other front end tools which was cool (and great to save for later). Only thing was he was usually the only person that could help on those areas so it meant all of those tickets had to go to George. The queue for him in the project weeks was always 1+ hours long, which meant you were stuck for longer than you might have if others could help with it. The other thing I would say is some of the lectures went so fast, would be nice to slow down a little - although a lot of the lectures George covered were the more complex issues where a lot of content had to be covered in one day. Overall legend of a teacher though!" },

Without George I don't know if I would have been able to understand as much as I did and most likely would not have been able to complete the course. He gave me strength on days when I wanted to give up and helped bring a smile to all our faces when it was obvious we were worn out from all the info. I could say more but I think he knows we truly 'loved' him. Be well mate!" },

  { source: "Batch 990 (Europe)", content: "I have been able to see the strengths of each teacher and in your case you have a very valuable one, you know how to read how we are in each moment and change the dynamics of the lecture or the live code. I have given some trainings and this, when you are doing it from a distance, is difficult. in one of your readings, the live code was easier than the challenge, but I don't remember which one, if I find a comment in slack I'll let you know. to solve the tickets, when the problem is not developed you don't provide the direct answer, you give us the necessary information, which is much more valuable so I have to put 5starts ! if you fancy a surfing or skateboarding trip to the Canary Islands here you have a home :) in exchange for some extra coding lessons :)" },

  { source: "Batch 990 (Europe)", content: "George was awesome, not a bad thing i can say about him, You keep rocking G-man" },
  { source: "Batch 990 (Europe)", content: "George was brilliant. Any ideas we had during out product weeks he fully got behind and helped us try and figure them out. He was very motivating and I really enjoyed having his as a TA. His problem-solving skills where amazing and he got really interested in what we were trying to do, giving hints and ideas of how to approach a certain problem. One of, if not, my favourite TAs." },
  { source: "Batch 990 (Europe)", content: "For me George was the one of the best teacher. He was so kind and open to help in any way, I think I'm gonna remember for a long time (I love to start a day with music) thank you for all George." },

  { source: "Batch 990 (Europe)", content: "George was one of my favourite teachers. His subject knowledge is excellent and his attitude, teaching style, and temperament create a relaxed but disciplined and challenging learning environment." },
  { source: "Batch 990 (Europe)", content: "Strengths: patient, clear explanations, easy-going, super friendly, encouraging" },
  { source: "Batch 990 (Europe)", content: "George is funny and makes the lectures engaging. I remember he sat with me for almost 40 minutes trying to help me understand one of the well easy concepts now but difficult back then. I think he has good technical skills. Sometimes though, he does go fast during the lectures but I think that it applies to every lecturer espeically when its a big topic. He has great problem solving skills and I've never had any issues during tickets with him and even in the lectures if there is some problem with the code, he will find it quickly and explain what he did wrong." },
  { source: "Batch 990 (Europe)", content: "George is a very competent teacher and he really knows what is doing, he can explain things in a clear way and he is a very nice and sympathetic person! Maybe sometime he goes a bit fast, but I think it understandable because he is a fast thinker, my only suggestions is to go a bit slower a repeat concepts more, because there are students, that are new to the topics of the bootcamp." },
  { source: "Batch 990 (Europe)", content: "I FOUND GEORGE A VERY ENGAGING TEACHER, AND VERY EASY TO FOLLOW IN HIS CLASSES. GEORGE WHEN HELPING THE CHALLENGES, GUIDES YOU WELL IN ORDER FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND, INSTEAD OF TAKING THE EASY ROAD AND JUST GIVING YOU THE ANSWER. I MUST SAY I HAD LEARNT A LOT AND HOW TO TACKLE PROBLEMS." },
  { source: "Batch 990 (Europe)", content: "Very knowledgeable and very much got everyone in the mood for learning with morning music!" },
  { source: "Batch 990 (Europe)", content: "He was very friendly and easy to ask any questions. I felt that he gave me always right suggestions and advice that's why I asked many times. Also, his reboot was great. it gave me a big chance to understand MVC well. In addition, he always leaves us today's lesson codes on his github. This is immensely helpful." },
  { source: "Batch 990 (Europe)", content: "George allies friendliness, great attitude and skill. During lectures he obviously cared about being understood and seemed to know exactly what he was talking about. During project weeks he was for me and many others a certainty that your ticket would help you advance. Big plus for Le Wagon, he is obviously a Ruby lover ;)" },
  { source: "Batch 990 (Europe)", content: "Any lesson with George was very good. He interacted a lot with us and nobody slept. Probably the best teacher we had." },
